It counts the characters you specify to query in the text you enter. For languages written with Latin alphabet, such as Turkish and English, that do not include Arabic and Hebrew, it applies the justification operation for fixed-width fonts in the desired page length and line width. It allows you to add page border simulation and page numbering features for the texts it performs justification in a way that resembles office document editing applications to be read in text editing applications.

You can experience the operation of the code on this page with text generators such as https://www.lipsum.com/, or you can run it using the content in your own "black layout" text format documents.

The most suitable use arrangement of the page for your "black layout" text content is only the text stacks where you enter "new lines" from paragraph to paragraph. Leaving a space after punctuation marks such as periods and commas will provide convenience.

Text reversal operations are applied to the page only to satisfy curiosity for those who may need them. There are no labels for the data entry and adjustment elements on the page, there are titles that appear when you hover the mouse cursor over them, which means I cannot recommend using them with touchscreen devices and I would like to point out that they are offered for the benefit of the generation that is used to using the mouse and keyboard "like before".

Where and how you will use your outputs is up to your imagination. If you are bored with document formats such as PDF and DOC, you can publish the content you will write in TXT format or create more formal ReadMe.Txts in addition to the explanations you make in Markdown format on Github. You may be able to evaluate the outputs of this page when you make "MANUAL" additions to the edits you will make here for the TXT format of the Markdown format.
